{"error_type": "UnknownError", "message": "GPT响应中缺少 'answer' 字段。", "problem": "Let $c$ and $d$ be constants. Suppose that the equation \\[\\frac{(x+c)(x+d)(x+8)}{(x+2)^2} = 0\\] has exactly $3$ distinct roots, while the equation \\[\\frac{(x+3c)(x+2)(x+4)}{(x+d)(x+8)} = 0\\] has exactly $1$ distinct root. Compute $100c + d.$", "solution": "For the first equation, the roots are $-c$, $-d$, and $-8$. Since there are exactly $3$ distinct roots, none of these roots can be $-2$ (to prevent the denominator from becoming zero). Therefore, $c, d, 2, 8$ must all be distinct.\n\nFor the second equation, $-2$ must be the only root, because when $x = -2$, the numerator is zero and the denominator is non-zero (since $d \\neq 8$ and $d \\neq 2$). This implies that neither $-3c$ nor $-4$ should introduce new distinct roots. \n\nSince $-4 \\neq -2$, it must make the denominator zero, which leads to $-4 + d = 0 \\Rightarrow d = 4$.\n\nFor $-3c$ not to introduce a new distinct root, it should either coincide with $-2$ or make the denominator zero. Since making the denominator zero is not allowed (as $d$ and $c$ must be distinct from $8$ and $2$), we must have $-3c = -2 \\Rightarrow c = \\frac{2}{3}$.\n\nHence, the two equations are \\[\\frac{(x+\\frac{2}{3})(x+4)(x+8)}{(x+2)^2} = 0\\] and \\[\\frac{(x+2)(x+2)(x+4)}{(x+4)(x+8)} = 0\\], which satisfy the conditions: the first equation has roots $x=-\\frac{2}{3}, -4, -8$, and the second equation has only the one root $x=-2$. Therefore, \\[100c + d = 100 \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) + 4 = \\boxed{70.67}.\\]"}
